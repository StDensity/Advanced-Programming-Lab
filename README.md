# Plant Disease Classification - Advanced Programming Lab

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook for the Advanced Programming lab assignment on plant disease image classification.

## Overview

The notebook demonstrates training a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to classify plant leaf diseases using a subset of the PlantVillage dataset. The goal is to build and improve a model capable of recognizing different disease classes from leaf images.
